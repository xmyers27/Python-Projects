Hello, my name is Angel Macias and this is my python project. The purpose of this project was to create a program that is a webscraper that allows us to scrape information from the Books to Scrape website. This program uses many different libraries, among those the most important being "requests" and "BeautifulSoup" to scrape information from the website such as the title, descriptions, prices, images and other information on the site. While this code is readily available, I would recommend running the program in a virtual environment to have a better organized running program.
