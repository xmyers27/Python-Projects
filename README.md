Hello, my name is Angel Macias and this is my python project. The purpose of this project was to create a program that is a webscraper that allows us to scrape information from the Books to Scrape website. This program uses many different libraries, among those the most important being "requests" and "BeautifulSoup" to scrape information from the website such as the title, descriptions, prices, images and other information on the site. While this code is readily available, I would recommend running the program in a virtual environment to have a better organized running program. 

Looking at the "requirments.txt" file you can see all the libraries used necessary for this project. Begining the project you would have to first install a virtual environment and activate it with the following commands in your terminal.
- "pip install virtualenv"
- "cd" into the directory where your virtual environment is located. Example: "cd path/to/environment"
- "Scripts\activate"

After activating your virtual environment, you should now install the required libraries for your project using the following commands.
- pip install requests
- pip install beautifulsoup
- pip freeze
The command pip freeze is to double check and make sure the library is installed.

Phases 1-3 do not necessarily have to be run to make this project work, they are the bits and pieces that make phase 4 work as phase 4 is all the phases put together. However running phases 1-3 might give you a better understanding of the overall project. Phase 4 is the file that you will want to run, and wherever you have the project downloaded is where the information that is being scraped will download. It will be downloaded locally on your computer, the book information as well as all of the images for the books.
